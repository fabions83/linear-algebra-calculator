# Linear Algebra Calculator
This is a project I created as a web application to help students in linear algebra solve and check numerous math problems 
while studying. The web link to the site is www.linearalgebraplus.com. The software can perform the following operations on matrices of up to 20 dimensions
  * Determinant of a square matrix
  * Matrix multiplication of two matrices
  * Row reduced echelon form of a matrix
  * Inverse of a square matrix
  * Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a square matrix

In designing my web application, I used python and the flask library as the backend of my application script, with html/css design for the user interface. In order to change my html according to user selections, I used jinja2 to make my website work dynamically. I also used the numpy, scipy, fractions, and sympy libraries to perform linear algebra operations on the matrices.
